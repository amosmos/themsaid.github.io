    <h1 class="blog-post-title">Mohamed Said</h1>

                <p>I'm a software developer from Cairo, Egypt. Spending most of my time building web applications with Laravel, VueJS, MySQL, and HTML/CSS.</p>

<h2>Previous work Experience:</h2>
<p>I've been a web developer for over 7 years working on various projects. However, The most important projects I’ve worked on so far are the ones listed below:</p>
<h3>Foodics.com</h3>

<h3>Jumpsuite.io</h3>
<p>An online marketplace for fitness programs. It connects personal trainers with clients, and allows people to search for trainers and customized fitness routines. It was built using laravel 5.0 and Vue.js</p>
