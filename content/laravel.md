I'm a software developer from Cairo, Egypt. Spending most of my time building web applications with Laravel, VueJS, MySQL, and HTML/CSS.

I'm also an occasional writer on my [blog](http://themsaid.com/) and [Medium space](https://medium.com/@themsaid), I write about software development and testing as well as my own point of view and life experiences.


## Previous work Experience:

I've been a web developer for over 7 years working on various projects. However, The most important projects I’ve worked on so far are the ones listed below:

### Foodics.com
Fooidcs is a restaurant management system built using laravel 5.2 and Vue.js, it’s basically an application that helps restaurant owners manage all the aspects of their business. The system is currently serving more than 100 restaurant in the Middle East.

### Jumpsuite.io
An online marketplace for fitness programs. It connects personal trainers with clients, and allows people to search for trainers and customized fitness routines. It was built using laravel 5.0 and Vue.js

The backend has controllers for managing training programs, generating analytics, and handling customer support. An API is also provided for the operation of a mobile application.

### Nafham.com
The biggest online educational platform in the Arab world, offering free video content explaining the school curricula of several Arab countries.  it was built using laravel 4.0

> During my past experience I’ve been handling the entire development process from idea to deployment, most of the time I was the only developer in the team. However, since I joined Foodics 2 years ago I’ve been managing a team of frontend, backend, and mobile developers.


> For the past 3 years, I've been working remotely with teams distributed in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and UAE.

## Education:

I was initially studying for a degree in Mechanical Engineering. However I dropped out 2 years ago as I got myself more involved in the software development field and realised it was my true passion.

## My Interests:

The (non coding) activity I'm interested in the most is swimming. I’m not a professional athlete, but I take all the opportunities I get to jump into the water. I also love travel and having adventures in new places.

As for movies, I'm a big sci-fi and action fan. Some of the favourites from the top of my head are: Interstellar,The Terminator Series, Xmen and Avengers, Cast Away, Braveheart and the list goes on...
