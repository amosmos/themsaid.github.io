    <h1 class="blog-post-title">My thoughts on 2016 and dreams for 2017</h1>

                <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>It's been a while since I wrote anything, I've been busy during the past few months making big changes to my life, putting more focus into my job and using the rest of the time
discovering new passions and things to learn about.</p>
<p>Back in 2015 my Wife and I decided we're done with living in Egypt, we knew that we need to leave the country as soon as we can as it really started to consume our soul, you might
think I'm exaggerating but I'm not, maybe before spending that much time on the internet we were fine living in a 3rd world country but that's not the case anymore, we wanted
to have more space to move and we started to bring out all the dreams we buried throughout our past few years here.</p>
<p>Anyways during 2016 we couldn't easily manage to leave the country, but at least we managed to leave Cairo, the biggest city where all the negative energy is concentrated, we found
a new home in Hurghada, which is a really nice city on the shore of the Red Sea, there we could find the peace of mind we've been looking for.</p>
<p>So this move was the biggest change in 2016, but not the only one, in 2016 I started to discover a new passion that I'm really in love with, I was never a sporty person but
I found great joy in freediving, I started practicing freediving only a couple of months ago and I just can't stand spending a few days without doing some dives.</p>
